## Quick Start

Use the commands that match the current project state:

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
npm start
npm run preview
npm run build
```

| Command | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `npm install` | Install project dependencies. |
| `npm run dev` | vite |
| `npm start` | expo start |
| `npm run preview` | vite preview |
| `npm run build` | vite build |
| `npm run lint` | eslint . |

## Operating Notes

- Keep real credentials out of the repository. Use local environment files, GitHub repository secrets, or the deployment platform secret manager.
- If a `.env.example` file exists, treat it as documentation only; never commit filled-in `.env` files.
- Before publishing screenshots, demos, or client examples, remove private names, internal paths, account IDs, and API endpoints.
- The `Repository Hygiene` workflow is a lightweight guardrail, not a replacement for product-specific tests.

## Delivery Checklist

- [ ] README describes the user, business outcome, and operating boundary.
- [ ] Setup or preview commands are current and do not rely on private machine state.
- [ ] No real secrets, private user data, or machine-local state are tracked.
- [ ] Screenshots, demos, or sample outputs are safe to share publicly when the repository is public.
- [ ] Product-specific tests or smoke checks are documented before production use.

## Roadmap

- Tighten the fastest path from clone to useful demo.
- Add project-specific screenshots, sample outputs, or a short walkthrough where useful.
- Promote repeated manual steps into scripts, tests, or documented workflows.
- Keep security, privacy, and licensing boundaries explicit as the project evolves.

## Maintainer Notes

Maintained by [Tony Sheng](https://github.com/shengdabai). This README is written as a business-facing handoff: it should help a future collaborator, client, or reviewer understand why the repository exists, how to inspect it, and what must be true before it is reused or shipped.
